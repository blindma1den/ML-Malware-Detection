# ML-Malware-Detection
A script focused on using machine learning to identify and combat malware threats within corporate networks. For educational purposes only.




The goal of this project is to showcase how machine learning can be applied to detect potential malware threats within a corporate environment. The code uses simplified binary features (0 or 1) as a representation of specific characteristics that may indicate the presence or absence of malware. In a real-world scenario, these binary values would be replaced by more complex and meaningful features.

Here's a breakdown of the key components of the code:

Dataset Creation: In a practical application, a dataset would be collected and prepared with real-world data. This dataset would include various features such as network traffic anomalies, CPU usage, and security events.
Preprocessing: Before applying machine learning, data preprocessing is essential. This involves tasks like data cleaning, normalization, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Selection: In a real project, you would select an appropriate machine learning model based on the nature of the data. Common models for malware detection include Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks.
Model Training: The selected model would be trained using the training data, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships that distinguish malware from legitimate samples.
Model Evaluation: After training, the model's performance is evaluated using the test dataset. Metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and others are used to assess how well the model can detect malware and avoid false positives.
Real-Time Usage: Once a model has been successfully trained and evaluated, it can be deployed in real-time to analyze new samples and determine if they contain malware or not. This could be part of a network security system or an enterprise threat detection system.

HOW TO RUN:

Install Python: Ensure that you have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system.
Install Required Libraries: You'll need to install the necessary Python libraries, such as pandas, scikit-learn (for machine learning), and any other libraries used in your project. You can install these libraries using the following command in your command prompt or terminal:
Copy code

pip install pandas scikit-learn
Create a Python Script: Create a new Python script (e.g., malware_detection.py) and paste the code provided earlier into this script.
Modify the Dataset: Replace the example data in the code with your own dataset. In a real project, you would have a dataset with actual features and labels. Ensure that your dataset is loaded correctly, or you can replace the example data with your own.
Run the Script: In your command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory where your Python script is located. Then, run the script using the following command:
Copy code
python malware_detection.py

View the Output: After running the script, it will perform the training and evaluation of the machine learning model using the provided data. The output will display metrics such as accuracy and a classification report.
